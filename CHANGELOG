@section Release Notes MIP-DD 2.0.0
***************************

Features
--------

- enable SCIP interface to restrict limits automatically with respect to a variability margin defined by parameter scip.limitspace
- read and write files of problems and solutions in arbitrary arithmetics if the solver library does not provide the functionality
- add objective limit option to the SCIP interface
- experimentally support exact-SCIP with VIPR as underlying certified solver
- support SoPlex as underlying solver

Performance improvements
------------------------

- restrict solver limit settings automatically in order to accelerate the process by default
- adjust number of batches every round automatically in order to maintain expenditure by default

Interface changes
----------

## SolverRetcode:

- add code COMPLETIONFAIL to signal a verification preparation error
- add code CERTIFICATIONFAIL to signal a verification check error

## SolverInterface:

- templatize arithmetic type to allow instance precision to be independent from solver precision
- add solution information to signature and return of readInstance() and writeInstance() to enable parsing and providing the reference solution
- move out Retcode and rename to SolverRetcode in order to simplify handling return codes
- make settings argument of doSetup() variable to restrict limit settings
- add method getSolvingEffort() to adapt batch number

New parameters
----------

- expenditure = -1 : calculate the number of batches by ceiled division of the solving effort defined in the solver interface (-1: use original, 0: keep batches)
- default value nbatches = 2 in order to try bisection initially

Fixed bugs
----------

- replace parameter type std::int64_t by long long to avert integral inconsistencies
- write setting files for automatically handled limits instead of for detailed verbosity level in order to ensure reproducibility of limit triggered issues
- use stable sum implementation for activity evaluations consistently
- only cancel scip pointer when ending up in an internal stage in order to avoid freeing aborts
- avoid partial setups in release mode if solver interface functions fail
- resolve negated variables to original variables before building the matrix

Build system
------------

- backdate fmt from 8 to 7 to conform c++ standard 14
- add compile option -ffp-contract=off or /fp:precise to enhance reproducibility across different systems
- provide symlink to scip library in bugger build directory for a reliable unique link at runtime
- introduce cmake parameter BUGGER_ARITHMETIC to select reduction arithmetic throughout templated bugger modifiers among float, double, longdouble, quad, and rational


@section Release Notes MIP-DD 1.0.0
