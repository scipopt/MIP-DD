@section Release Notes MIP-DD NEXT
***************************

Features
--------

- enable SCIP interface to restrict limits automatically with respect to a variability margin defined by parameter scip.limitspace
- support SoPlex as underlying solver

Performance improvements
------------------------

- restrict solver limit settings automatically in order to accelerate the process by default
- adjust number of batches every round automatically in order to maintain expenditure by default

Interface changes
----------

SolverInterface:
- templatize SolverInterface to allow debugging in customized arithmetic (numerical exact for example)
- changed signature and return-type of SolverInterface-readInstance to support also parsing the solution additional to the settings and instance
- Retcode renamed to SolverRetcode and moved out of the SolverInterface
- parameters of doSetup made const
- added function getSolvingEffort

New parameters
----------

- expenditure = -1 : calculate the number of batches by ceiled division of the solving effort defined in the solver interface (-1: use original, 0: keep batches)
- default value nbatches = 2 in order to try bisection initially

Fixed bugs
----------

- replace parameter type std::int64_t by long long to avert integral inconsistencies
- write setting files for automatically handled limits instead of for detailed verbosity level in order to ensure reproducibility of limit triggered issues
- use stable sum implementation for activity evaluations consistently
- only cancel scip pointer when ending up in an internal stage in order to avoid freeing aborts

Build system
------------

- backdate fmt from 8 to 7 to conform c++ standard 14
- add compile option -ffp-contract=off or /fp:precise to enhance reproducibility across different systems
- provide symlink to scip library in bugger build directory for a reliable unique link at runtime
- introduce cmake parameter BUGGER_ARITHMETIC to select reduction arithmetic throughout templated bugger modules among float, double, longdouble, quad, and rational
